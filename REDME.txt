Data set attributes:
          step - maps a unit of time in the real world. In this case 1 step is 1 hour of time. Total steps 744 (30 days simulation).

          type - CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER.
          
          amount - amount of the transaction in local currency.
          
          nameOrig - customer who started the transaction
          
          oldbalanceOrg - initial balance before the transaction
          
          newbalanceOrig - new balance after the transaction
          
          nameDest - customer who is the recipient of the transaction
          
          oldbalanceDest - initial balance recipient before the transaction. Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants).
          
          newbalanceDest - new balance recipient after the transaction. Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants).
          
          isFraud - This is the transactions made by the fraudulent agents inside the simulation. In this specific dataset the fraudulent behavior of the agents aims to profit by taking control or customers accounts and try to empty the funds by transferring to another account and then cashing out of the system.
The dataset attribute are self explaintory .
What is dont in the minor ml project is that have utlized the data to train a model that can succesfully predict which transctionn is fraud.
Most part of model trainiing and preprocessing is explained in the jupyter notebook itself.
Have a look at it.
